          { "text": "The first Corvette started off as an idea pushed by Harley Earl, GM's head of styling and a fan of sporting (sports) cars. Harley recognized the growing postwar demand for luxury and sports cars after seeing GI's bringing home cars from foreign manufacturers such as Fiat, MG, Alfa-Romeo and Jaguar. At the time, no other domestic manufacturer was producing a vehicle that fit these categories while being priced low enough to be considered by the returning GI's, so Earl went to GM and convinced them of the need for an all-American sports car. Having gotten the go ahead, Earl, assisted by his Special Projects crew and Head of Experimental Styling Bob McLean, began work on the new concept car in late 1951.",

          { "text": "Codenamed Project Opel, the car took 2 years to produce, and was eventually revealed at the General Motors Motorama at the Waldorf-Astoria on January 17th, 1953. The car on display was designated EX-122, the serial number used for the concept car (with the EX standing for experimental), and showcased a full fiberglass body, the first to be used on any production car at the time. The positive public reaction the concept received at Motorama was incredible and served to strengthen GM's resolve to bring the car to market as soon as possible. While not the first postwar sports car to be produced (that title goes to the Crosley Hotshot), the Corvette would be GM's first all-American sports car since the Chevrolet Master in 1938.",

The first Corvettes wouldn't be built until early June of 1953, with the first production model being completed on June 30th of the same year. However, before production had even started, all 300 units had been spoken for, a practice unheard of at the time. While exciting at first, this was the start of some significant problems the C1 would encounter.",

At the time, fiberglass molding techniques were in their infancy, and as a result most of the 46 fiberglass body pieces had defects that would not allow them to fit together properly. These defects had to be corrected by hand at the time of fitment which, when cosidering all 300 units were put together in the back of a customer delivery garage, caused significant delays in production. To reduce delays, and because the first few Corvettes were literally being engineered as they were assembled, all 300 units were sold with the same features and options.",

While being marketed as a luxury \"sports car\", the 1953 model year was powered by a \"Blue Flame\" inline 6-cylinder motor that produced only 150hp. The Blue Flame did boast better performance the the Stovebolt motor it was based off of, with a more aggresive cam, solid lifters, dual valve springs, an upgraded air intake and triple Carter-YH Sidedraft carburetors, but the 45hp bump still didn't satisfy customers and GM refused to share any of it's V8 motors with the new concept car. That, and the 2-speed Powerglide Automatic, which at the time of production would not always shift from low to high gearing, made the Corvette slow off the line and gave it an awful 0-60 time of just over 11.2 seconds.",

With the body issues and production rush, manual or power windows were instead swapped out for crude plexi glass inserts which were prone to leaking, and the jet-age inspired interior, while stylish, was mostly non functional.",

The intent behind this was to market pre-sales of the Corvette, relying on testimonials from VIP owners and a campaign that praised the cars styling, performance and grandeur. While normally an ingenious campaign, VIP's of the first cars didn't like it anywhere near as much as GM had hoped, and the inflated final price of $3490 put the car out of the affordable price range of those it was marketed towards. Though all units were sold, the Corvette was starting to look like a potential failure, and GM really began to question the viability of this new sports car.",
