1953 Corvette timeline

Harley Earl sees people, mainly a lot of GI's, coming home and buying foreign roadsters
Seeing this, Harley proposes idea of an all american roadster/sports car to GM. They're convinced
Harley, with the help of his Special Projects team and Bob McLean, head of experimental styling, they created the EX-122
EX-122 gets shown at GM Motorama. Public reaction is incredibly positive, GM moves forward to produce the car
Production is in full effect by late May, early June in the back of a client elivery garage in NJ
Corvettes are engineered as they're put together due to issues with the fitment of the fiberglass body pieces
GM sets target of 50 corvettes per month, with a cap of 300. Due to ongoing issues with fiberglass fitment, all 300 Corvettes are equipped the same
Corvettes marketed as a comfort and convenience sports car, potential customers are used to sports car meaning raw and unforgiving, question sports claims
Because of negative corvette image, GM decides to sell only to VIP's to make corvette seem exclusive. All units sell out before first car has been produced
First Corvette rolls out of the factory on June 30th with a canvas top and crude mountable (not roll up) plexiglass windows and curtains
GM unwilling to share one of it's V8's with the first Corvettes, so it's powered by a 'Blue Flame' inline 6-cylinder and a 2 speed floor shifted powerglide automatic
To make up for the lower I6 power, GM engineers used a more radical camshaft with solid lifters, dual valve springs, and bumped the compression to 8.0:1 from 7.5. They also sent it out with triple sidedraft carbs, giving it a final 150hp instead of 105hp
GM continues marketing campaign for corvette, Relies on VIP opinion to boost Corvette image/reputation
VIP's aren't happy with the new Corvette, Corvette image continues to get worse, GM questions viability of new Corvette
